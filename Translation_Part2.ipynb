    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project we will consider **neural networks**:  a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for performing neural machine translation (i.e. translating from one language into another).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided into parts. In **Part 1**, you will implement an RNN model for performing the neural machine translation. In **Part 2**, you will analyze these models in two types of comparative studies and in **Part 3** you will answer questions describing what you have learned through this project. You also will be required to submit a description of libraries used, how your group divided up the work, and your feedback regarding the assignment (**Part 4**).\n",

    "that you understand not only what you are doing but also why and how you are doing it. So be clear, organized and concise; avoid vagueness and excess verbiage. Spend time doing error analysis for the models. This is how you understand the advantages and drawbacks of the systems you build. The reports should read more like the papers that we have been writing critiques for."

We'll simply refer to it as NMT or Neural Machine Translation in the project.\n",

    "We will minimally preprocess the source/target sentences and handle tokenization in what we release. For this assignment, we do not anticipate any further preprocessing to be done by you.

This differs from a field like Computer Vision where images are (generally) of a fixed size.\n",

We can look at how well our translation _overlaps_ with the reference translation. A common metric for this is the **BLEU** (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric. The approach works by counting matching n-grams in the candidate translation to n-grams in the reference text, where 1-gram or unigram would be each token and a bigram comparison would be each word pair. The comparison is made regardless of word order. BLEU uses N-grams of size 1-4 in its computation."

    "A large aspect of rigorous experimentation in NLP (and other domains) is the _ablation study_. In this, we _ablate_ or remove aspects of a more complex model, making it less complex, to evaluate whether each aspect was neccessary. To be concrete, for this part, you should train 4 variants of the RNN model and describe them as we do below:\n",

    "2. Baseline model made more complex by modification $A$ (e.g. changing the hidden dimensionality from $h$ to $2h$).\n",

    "4. Baseline model with both modifications $A$ and $B$ applied.\n",

    "Under the framing of an ablation study, you would describe this as beginning with model 4 and then ablating (i.e. removing) each of the two modifications, in turn; and then removing both to see if they were genuinely neccessary for the performance you observe. \n",

    "1. _Nuanced quantitative analysis_ \\\n",
    "If you choose this option, you will need to further break down the quantitative statistics you reported initially. We provide some initial strategies to prime you for what you should think about in doing this: one possible starting point is to consider: if model $X$ achieves greater accuracy than model $Y$, to what extent is $X$ getting everything correct that $Y$ gets correct? Alternatively, how is model performance affected if you measure performance on a specific strata/subset of the source sentences?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Nuanced qualitative analysis_ \\\n",
