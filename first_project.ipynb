    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project we will build an **n-gram-based language model** for deceptive review classification. We will also investigate a feature-based **Naive Bayes model**. The task we are faced with is to **decide whether a hotel review is deceptive or truthful**. This is a relavent problem as websites that contain consumer reviews are a target of opinion spam. Typically, these deceptive opinions are neither easily ignored nor even identifiable by a human reader so we'd like to assist in flagging reviews. The dataset we are investigating looks at *deceptive opinion spam*, that is decetive opinions that have been purposely written to sound genuine ([Ott et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4557.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us approach this problem, we will use NLP techniques covered thus far to frame this as a (supervised) binary classification task, where each opinion will have a label $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where *0 indicates a truthful review* and *1 indicates a deceptive one*. You will train and validate your two different models and then run them on a test data set with hidden $y$ labels. You will then submit the results on the test data set to Kaggle to participate in our class-wide competition!\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided into six parts:\n",
    "1. Dataset loading and preprocessing\n",
    "2. Unsmoothed n-gram language model (LM): build the unsmoothed n-gram language model using our Fake Review corpus. \n",
    "3. Smoothed n-gram language model: build a smoothed version of the model from part 2.\n",
    "4. Perplexity: compute perplexity for both the unsmoothed and smoothed model\n",
    "5. Putting everything together and submitting the first model to Kaggle\n",
    "6. Naive Bayes: build a feature-based Naive Bayes model to perform the same classification task. Compare the LM with Naive Bayes and identify the pros and cons of each."

    "- You should work in **groups of 2 students**. Students in the same group will get the same grade. Thus, you should make sure that everyone in your group contributes to the project. \n",
    "- **Remember to form groups on BOTH CMS and Gradescope** or not all group members will receive grades. You can use make a post on EdStem to find a partner for this project.\n",
    "- Please complete the written questions of this notebook in a clear and informative way. We have created a template document for you to answer the written questions. This document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11GX5vG8TeHk1F2eakOgbTFaqYl3lfvZf9fYoMUTVGMs/edit?usp=sharing). Please make a copy of this document for yourself and add your names and netids in the header and answer the written questions on it. You will need to submit this document to gradescope as well (do not forget to do this please!).\n",
    "- At the end: please make sure to submit the following 3 items:\n",
    "  1. PDF version of Colab notebook on Gradescope (instructions for converting to PDF are at the end).\n",
    "  2. PDF version of Google Doc with written answers on Gradescope.\n",
    "  3. .ipynb version of your colab notebook on CMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice:** The written questions is where you get to show us that you understand not only what you are doing but also why and how you are doing it. So be clear, organized and concise; avoid vagueness and excess verbiage. Spend time doing error analysis for the models. This is how you understand the advantages and drawbacks of the systems you build. It's also useful to think about how the theory of n-grams/Naive Bayes bridges with the real world application we are building. Think about what you expect from these models based on your current understanding, and then see if your expectation aligns with empirical results that you'll get. "

    "Real review example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party, and was disappointed. The hotel is beautiful, the staff was all rather friendly. The main problem was the room/sleeping situation. We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before, but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out (how that happens I don't know!!) so they \"upgraded\" us to two \"suites\" with a king and a pull out. First, this meant our party was split up and on different floors. Second, that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch. :( I'm not a picky, unreasonable person, but that was the WORST \"bed\" I've ever slept on! It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed. Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night! Just awful! For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable! I would not stay here again after this experience.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fake review example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I truly enjoyed my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. We stayed in a suite, which was clean and extremely nice, at a very reasonable rate. My husband and I spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool, but personally I preferred laying out on the sundeck. Service was excellent; they were friendly and all of our needs were met promptly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great experience in the downtown Chicago area.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset folder you should find 2 files, training and validation splits for both real and fake reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will proceed generally as follows in terms of code development:\n",
    "1. Write code to train unsmoothed unigram and bigram language models for an arbitrary corpus\n",
    "2. Implement smoothing and unknown word handling. \n",
    "3. Implement the Perplexity calculation. \n",
    "4. Using 1, 2 and 3, together with the provided training and validation sets, develop a language-model-based approach for Fake Review Classification.\n",
    "5. Apply your best language-model-based review classifier (from 4) to the\n",
    "provided test set. Submit the results to the online Kaggle competition. \n",
    "6. Use any existing implementation of Naive Bayes (and the provided training and validation sets) to create an additional Naive Bayes fake review classifier. Apply your best NB classifier to the provided test set. Submit the results to the separate Kaggle competition (for NB classifiers). \n",
    "\n",

    "## 1.3 Data Preprocessing & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a well-known parable in machine learning that 80% of the work is all about data preparation, 10% is supporting infrastructure and 10% is actual modeling. If your \"raw\" dataset is not preprocessed and prepared in a way to maximize its value, then your model will be more like this: https://xkcd.com/1838/. For this project, modeling is the star of the show for learning purposes, but we still want you to pay attention to the preprocessing stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We've already tokenized and lowercased* the raw data for you. We have not added a start of sentence token but feel free to do so (it is not neccessary). Here are a few extra things you might want to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about edge cases. For example, you don't want to accidentally append a period to the last word of a sentence. \n",
    "- Watch out for apostrophes and other tricky things like quotations, they cause lots of edge cases. For example, \"they're\" can be all one token, or two tokens (\"they\", \"'re\") or even three tokens (\"they\", \" ' \", \"re\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Why did we lowercase all tokens? Because the computer will otherwise consider \"The\" and \"the\" as two separate words and this will cause problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you may use existing\n",
    "tools just for the purpose of preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advice: don't get bugged down in the dozens of preprocessing packages and suggestions that you can find on Towards Data Science or Stack Overflow. Start with this [NLTK tutorial](https://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/cs.pitt.edu/projects/nltk/docs/tutorial/introduction/nochunks.html#:~:text=The%20Natural%20Language%20Toolkit%20(NLTK,tokenization%2C%20tagging%2C%20and%20parsing.) and that should be plenty."
